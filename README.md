# odin-recipes
A short HTML project.
During this project I will practice using HTML and GitHub. As I work, I will save often and practice writing good commit messages. Get used to using the terminal commands to stage and push updates to GitHub. Learn and use HTML tags and elements and possibly learn about attributes.
